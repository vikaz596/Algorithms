declare fib_table as array; all values initialized to 0

function fib_memo(n)
   if (n = 0)
      return 0
   if (n = 1)
      return 1

   if (fib_table[n] == 0)
     fib_table[n] = fib_memo(n-1) + fib_memo(n-2)

   return fib_table[n]

Be careful when choosing a default value for the memoization table. Zero is fine for this example,
because the only time zero appears is for F_{0}, which is accounted for explicitly.
If your function's range is all integers, you may have to use an auxiliary table to keep track of 
whether a specific value has been computed.
